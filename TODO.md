- Separate the vertex data and the texture data. Use a 3D texture for each chunk to specify which cube should use which texture
- Add at least 4-5 different block types (e.g. sand, grass, snow, dirt, etc.)
- Implement occlusion culling
- Implement Chunk loading as the player moves
- Implement Chunk offloading to disk as the player moves (and reloading again)
